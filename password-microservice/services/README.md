# Services Folder üìÇ

## Overview üåü

The **services** folder is responsible for managing the core business logic of the application. In the **passwordService.js** file, the primary responsibility is to interact with the **passwordGenerator** utility to generate strong, secure passwords.

### Role of the **passwordService.js** File üìù

- **Password Generation**: The **passwordService.js** file defines the **PasswordService** class, which acts as a mediator between the controller layer and the password generation logic. It invokes the **PasswordGenerator** utility to generate secure passwords.
- **Encapsulation of Logic**: By delegating the password generation to a dedicated utility, the **passwordService.js** file keeps the core logic of password generation encapsulated, making the service class lightweight and focused on delegating tasks.
- **Simplification for Consumers**: The **PasswordService** exposes a simple method, `generatePassword()`, which can be easily called by other parts of the application, like controllers or other services, to obtain a generated password.

### Why This Folder Is Important üîë

- **Centralized Business Logic**: The **services** folder is where the application's core business logic is housed. By centralizing the password generation logic in the service layer, we ensure that password creation is handled in one location, making the code easier to maintain and scale.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The **passwordService.js** file follows the **separation of concerns** principle. The service doesn't directly handle HTTP requests or responses; it focuses on business logic, leaving that task to the controller layer. This ensures each part of the application is focused on a single responsibility.
- **Extensibility**: As new password generation features are added (e.g., generating passwords with different complexity requirements), the service layer can be easily extended, while the controller remains unchanged.

### In Summary üìù
The **services** folder contains the core logic of the application. The **passwordService.js** file manages the creation of passwords by utilizing the **passwordGenerator.js** utility. This clear separation of concerns and modular structure ensures that the application is easy to maintain, extend, and integrate with other parts of the system.

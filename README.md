# Authentication2 Domain 🚀

## Overview 🌟

The **Authentication2** repository contains key microservices that serve critical functions for user authentication. Specifically, it includes two primary microservices:

1. **Captcha Microservice**: This service is designed to generate CAPTCHA challenges to secure login forms, preventing spam and automated login attempts.
2. **Password Microservice**: This service generates secure and random passwords for users, ensuring that passwords are strong and comply with best practices for security.

These microservices are designed to be lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate into any authentication system. They enhance security and user experience by automating processes that are otherwise tedious and error-prone.

## Purpose 💡

The purpose of this domain is to provide essential security-related services for user authentication. With these services, we aim to:

- **Prevent Spam and Bots**: By using the **Captcha Microservice**, login forms are protected from automated abuse, ensuring that only real users can access the system.
- **Enhance Password Security**: The **Password Microservice** ensures that users are provided with strong, randomly generated passwords, reducing the likelihood of weak passwords being used in the system.

## Architecture 🏗️

### Microservices Architecture 🔥
- The **Authentication2** domain follows a **microservices architecture**. Each service is self-contained, ensuring independent scalability and deployment.
- The **Captcha Microservice** generates CAPTCHA challenges for the user, which are validated during the login process.
- The **Password Microservice** provides a secure method for generating strong passwords, avoiding common pitfalls like predictable passwords.

### Design Patterns 📝
- **Controller-Service Pattern**: Both microservices follow the **controller-service pattern**. The controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, while the services contain the core business logic for generating CAPTCHAs and passwords.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Both services are stateless, ensuring that they can scale horizontally without the need for session persistence.

## Key Microservices 🛠️

### 1. **Captcha Microservice** 🎯
- **Function**: Generates CAPTCHA challenges that are presented to the user during the login process.
- **API Endpoint**: `/generate-captcha` (GET)
- **Security**: Helps prevent spam and bot attacks by verifying that the user is human before allowing login attempts.

### 2. **Password Microservice** 🔑
- **Function**: Generates secure, random passwords for users to ensure that passwords are strong and not easily guessable.
- **API Endpoint**: `/generate-password` (GET)
- **Security**: Provides randomly generated passwords to ensure the use of complex passwords that adhere to security best practices.

## How to Deploy 🛠️

Both microservices are **containerized with Docker**, allowing them to be easily deployed in various environments. This makes it possible to run them independently, scale them, and deploy them on any cloud platform or server.
